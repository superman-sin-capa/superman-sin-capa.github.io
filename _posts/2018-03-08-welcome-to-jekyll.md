Our house has a fairly steep backyard. At some point the previous owners terraced it into two wide paths. At the top of the hill and next to the street is our house. Some stairs lead down from the back of the house to the first terrace. However to get from the first terrace to the bottom terrace you need to walk down a steep rocky slope. It is slippery and dangerous and not conducive to walking down in sandals.
